# Norsk e-Fuel student summer job assignment - April 2025

In this repository you will find:

1. assignment_norsk_efuel.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook where you complete the assignment
2. data/ - Folder with the data files you need to use for the assignment.

Please complete the tasks in the Notebook and then save it. You will present your Notebook in the next
interview.

We recommend you use Python 3.12 but other versions should work. We expect that you know how to configure
a working Python environment using Conda or Venv.

Note. You may use any tool to complete the tasks including ChatGPT or similar. However, we will be asking
you questions to ensure that you have understood the code. You will also need to be able to reason on your solution.

We wish you the best of luck and look forward to discussing the assignment with you!
