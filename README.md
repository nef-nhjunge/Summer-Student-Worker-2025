# Norsk e-Fuel student summer job assignment - April 2025

In this repository you will find:

1. assignment_norsk_efuel.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook where you complete the assignment
2. data/ - Folder with the data files you need to use for the assignment.

## Data

In the data folder you will find three files

- lst.vbk_projekteringsomraden.zip - This is geodata for all wind farms in Sweden
- LST.vbk_projekteringsomraden_shp_information.txt - Accompanied information document of the wind farm dataset
- VBK_export_allman_prod.xlsx - An Excel file with detailed data of the Swedish wind farms. It has information such as the number of turbines, installed power, height, etc. (If you don't see the header row in the Excel file, you likely need to expand the row height by dragging down the row. This is a formatting issue with the file.)

## Completing the assignment

You are to complete all tasks in the assignment in the Jupyter notebook.
You will present your notebook with in the next interview to discuss the tasks and your solution.

We recommend you use Python 3.12 but other versions should work. We expect that you know how to configure
a working Python environment with Anaconda or Venv.

You may use any tool to complete the tasks including ChatGPT or similar. However, we will be asking
you questions to ensure that you have understood the assignment and the code. We also expect that you can reason on your solution.

We wish you the best of luck and look forward to discussing the assignment with you!
